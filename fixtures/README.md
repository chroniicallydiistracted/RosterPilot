# Test Fixtures

Store sanitized Yahoo and PyESPN JSON responses here for unit,
integration, and contract tests. Organize subdirectories by provider and
resource, for example:

```
yahoo/
  leagues/
  rosters/
pyespn/
  events/
  plays/
```

Follow the data provenance guidelines and redact league or user-specific
information before committing new fixtures.

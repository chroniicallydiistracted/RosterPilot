# Architecture Notes

Use this space to evolve the system design as we progress through the
phases defined in `SCAFFOLD_PHASE_PLAN.md`.

Suggested artifacts:

- C4 context, container, and component diagrams
- Sequence diagrams for Yahoo OAuth, ingest pipelines, and optimizer
  interactions
- Infrastructure topology showing Cloud Run, Neon, Upstash, and
  Cloudflare Pages

Update this document whenever new architectural decisions are captured
in ADRs or `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

# RosterPilot Documentation Hub

This directory aggregates engineering documentation that complements the
product vision outlined in `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and
`SCAFFOLD_PHASE_PLAN.md`. Each sub-directory focuses on a specific
stream so teams can work in parallel while staying aligned.

## Structure

- `DEV_SETUP.md` – Local environment bootstrap aligned with the
  environment variables defined in `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`.
- `architecture/` – C4 diagrams, deployment topology, and component
  contracts that evolve with the implementation.
- `api/` – OpenAPI exports, example payloads, and contract notes for
  REST and WebSocket surfaces.

Additional guides (optimizer math notes, QA playbooks, etc.) should live
alongside these folders as they materialize.
